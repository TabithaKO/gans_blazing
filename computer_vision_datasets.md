## Computer Vision Datasets 
I will highlight some resources to get you started in creating your own computer vision models. This list will continue to grow in perpetuity because new datasets arise whenever there is a need for computer vision to solve a new niche task.

Here are some websites with a wide variety of tasks. Be sure to check the licenses for each dataset in order to avoid legal hiccups in the event that you create a commercial product.

- [Paperspace](https://www.paperspace.com/) is a cloud computing platform that allows you to train machine learning models for free for up to 6 hours. They have premium computing for longer timeframes at a cost. (Disclaimer: At the time of writing, I work @Paperspace :)) They provide access to a lot of largescale datasets and pretrained models( eg. Stable Diffusion, YOLO)

- [Roboflow](https://public.roboflow.com/) provides access to over 40 computer vision datasets as well as pretrained models to get you started on your computer vision dataset. They also provide data annotation tools in the event that you want to curate your own dataset for your own task

- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is a datascience community platform that enables members to access vast ML datasets, create jupyter notebooks, access limited free computing resources, and compete in various ML competitions. It is a great place to find opensource datasets along with notebooks showing you how to explore the properties of the datasets.

- [Open Images](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/download.html) is Google's opensource data collection for various tasks (e.g. Object Detection, Image classification). The [AI Guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4A9inxGqRM&t=382s) has a pretty cool video on how to explore this resource to create a custom dataset. 

- [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/datasets) is an amazing place to find datasets linked to published research papers. This is a great resource for replicating results from a research paper or building on published work.
