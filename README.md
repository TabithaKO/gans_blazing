## Dlib.ipynb ðŸ’« 
The Dlib algorithm allows you to perfrom landmark detection on a face. I edited the code to highlight 8 uniqe landmarks but the original model can definitely highlight many more models. The notebook allows you to implement this model on a single image or a video.

## FaceParse_CelebA.ipynb ðŸ’«  
The face parse model was trained on celebA-HQ. There are 18 unique classes that are segmented on the face image.The notebook allows you to implement this model on a single image or a video.

## Mediapipe.ipynb ðŸ’«  
This a landmark detection model with over 400 landmarks (so you can get really precise with your landmarks). Read more from the authors [here](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/face_mesh.html) The notebook allows you to perfrom the landmark detection on a video and generate side by side comparison. The original notebook by a separate author is [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/kevinash/awesome-ai/blob/main/notebooks/5_FacesAndExpressions/MediaPipe_Face_Mesh.ipynb)
